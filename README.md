Motivation:
 A Diary acts as a memory sink for all kinds of memories good or bad. One can get more organised by jotting down their thoughts and can revisit their fond memories whenever they want. As time is advancing, people are getting busy more and more, day by day. Almost everyone has forgotten the art of diary writing.
In this project a digital Personal Diary has been developed.
